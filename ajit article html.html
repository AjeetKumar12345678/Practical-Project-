India are off to a forgettable start in the Women's T20 World Cup 2024 as they lost their opening game against New Zealand by 58 runs in Dubai. Batting first, The Blackcaps posted a total of 160/4 with skipper Sophie Devine scoring an unbeaten 57. Later, Team India got bundled out for 102 as Rosemary Mair registered a four-wicket haul. This match had a big controversial moment when batter Amelia Kerr was declared not out on a run out appeal, prompting India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur to indulge in a heated discussion with the umpires.
</p>
<p>
The incident took place on the last delivery of the 14th over, when Kerr played over to long-off and went for a single. However, while Harmanpreet at long-off thought that the ball was dead, Kerr decided to go for a second run and was actually run out before completing the double. However, by that time, the umpire had already given the cap back to Deepti Sharma and signalled the end of play.

<p>
While India appealed for a run out and even Kerr made her way back to the dugout, the umpires decided that the ball was dead and  as a result, the run out was not valid.

This incident grabbed a lot of attention and raised questions on the credibility of the rules. Veteran India all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin also took to X (formerly Twitter) and expressed his concerns on this incident. However, he later deleted the tweet. 

"The over was called before the start of the second run. Whose fault is this really? @prithinarayanan," Ashwin wrote before deleting his post.

<h1>India Look To Iron Out Combination Flaws, Regain Fight In Crucial T20 World Cup Game Against Pakistan</h1>
<img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/nu787k1o_harmanpreet-jemimah-icc_625x300_05_October_24.jpeg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605" width="600px" align="center">
<p>India will have to regroup quickly and iron out the imbalances in team combination when they face arch-rivals Pakistan in a crucial second group A match of the Women's T20 World Cup in Dubai on Sunday. An early 58-run defeat to New Zealand on Friday has not just dented India's chances of entering the semifinals of the ICC showpiece, but it certainly has pushed them to a tight corner. India's run-rate currently stands at a poor -2.99 and it makes big victories mandatory for them in the remaining three matches against Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia.</p>
<p>The Harmanpreet Kaur-led side was wretched in all three departments of the game against the Kiwis in its World Cup opener, and India now need a reversal within 24 hours.

It's tough but that is the path they have to tread against Pakistan, high on confidence after beating a strong Sri Lanka in the first match on Thursday.

As a first step, India will have to sort out their combinations ahead of the Pakistan game.</p>
